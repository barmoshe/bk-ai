## Key Design Decisions

1. **Multi-Character First**: Designed from the ground up for rosters, not single characters
2. **Style Lock**: All characters share the same art style for consistency
3. **Age-Appropriate**: Different UI, props, and prompts based on age band
4. **Safety First**: Content filtering, validation, and safe defaults throughout
5. **MVP-Ready**: Works with emoji placeholders, ready for real image generation
6. **Extensible**: Easy to add more archetypes, props, and style options
7. **Professional Prompts**: 500+ lines of optimized prompt engineering
8. **Backward Compatible**: Legacy steps still work

## What Works Right Now

✅ Browse 12 diverse character archetypes
✅ Add 1 main character + up to 2 sidekicks
✅ Create custom AI characters with safety filters
✅ Customize character names
✅ Add up to 4 props per character from 18+ options
✅ Generate 4 cohesive character-set options
✅ Select a style-locked set
✅ Navigate through 3-part Step 1 flow
