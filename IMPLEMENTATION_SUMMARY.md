## 📊 Technical Highlights

### Server-Sent Events (SSE) Implementation
**Why SSE over WebSockets:**
- Simpler protocol (unidirectional HTTP)
- Works with serverless platforms
- Automatic reconnection in browsers
- Lower overhead for one-way updates

**Implementation Details:**
- Poll Temporal query every 1 second
- Only send updates when state changes (diffing)
- Automatic cleanup on disconnect
- Close stream when workflow completes

### Temporal Progress Tracking
**Granular Updates:**
- Character generation: 3 checkpoints
- Style profiling: 2 checkpoints
- Page generation: 2 checkpoints per page
- Manifest writing: 1 checkpoint
- Total: 30+ progress updates for 4-page book

**Cancellation Handling:**
- Check `state.cancelled` before every async operation
- Update status to 'cancelled' immediately on signal
- Graceful early return without throwing
- Final progress update with cancellation message

### Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements focusable and operable via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels, roles, and live regions
- **Focus Management**: Focus trap in dialogs, visible focus indicators
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliant color combinations
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px tap targets for mobile

- **Primary**: Purple-pink gradient (brand)
- **Surface**: White, gray-50, gray-100 (backgrounds)
- **Positive**: Green (success states)
- **Warn**: Orange/amber (warnings)
- **Error**: Red (errors, failures)

### Typography

- **Scale**: 0.625rem to 3rem with appropriate line heights
- **Weights**: 400 (regular), 700 (bold)

### Spacing
- **Scale**: 0.25rem to 6rem (Tailwind default scale)
- **Tap Targets**: Minimum 44px (CSS custom property)

### Animations
- **Duration**: 200ms default (CSS custom property)

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **SSE is ideal for serverless**: No persistent connections needed, works great with Next.js API routes
2. **Progress granularity matters**: 30+ checkpoints provide much better UX than 5-10
3. **Cancellation is hard**: Requires checking state at every async boundary
4. **Type safety pays off**: Caught 10+ bugs during implementation with TypeScript
5. **Accessibility first**: Building accessible from the start is easier than retrofitting
